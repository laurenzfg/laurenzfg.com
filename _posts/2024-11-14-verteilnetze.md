lead_text: "Encryption is essential for wireless communication in critical infrastructures such as Power Distribution Networks, but it burdens resource-constrained devices and networks. During my time at <a href='https://spice.rwth-aachen.de'>SPICe</a>, I contributed a highly configurable framework to measure various TLS handshakes over a proprietary 4G test network. First results appeared at the 2024 Cyber Security in Networking Conference (CSNet)."
