# Open Source

While I do not contribute to any open source project in particular, I pride myself with a hands-on attitude towards all open source software I use. Please feel free to review my PRs merged into various projects at
[GitHub](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Alaurenzfg+archived%3Afalse+is%3Amerged+-user%3Alaurenzfg).

## FBThrift

During my time at Meta, I was able to close a gap between the Python and Go implementations in the fbthrift implementation of the Thrift RPC framework:
[Add Factories for JSON+SimpleJSON Serializers](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift/commit/668e8fa2f0e464aac1bd79860f7b991330686224).
